FIX
- LEDs currently being driven by 1.8 V, needs transistor and higher driving voltage
- Add two pull up resistors on FXAS21002C interrupt pins

1.0.1
- Replaced R1,R2,R3,R4 560 ohm resistors with 33 ohm resistors
- Replaced 1V8, IND1, IND2, IND3 blue LEDs with green LEDs
- Replaced J2 TMMH-120-01-F-D header with TMMH-120-01-F-D header
